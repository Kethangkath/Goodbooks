using JSON, create the book objects so that the user can fetch the books from the search button

books available are fictional and don't exist in the real world. Content will be generated by GPT

Feature some books on the main homepage..like say "Most read", "Most liked",blah blah blah more like a carousal! On hitting next arrow key, 
previous book must also be sightly visible. Same with the next book.

Only when signed in, users can read the books. Else only the first page lol
